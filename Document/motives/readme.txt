The motive is to impress anyone who comes through here:

Software devs:
    Impress them with the code architecture,
    code structure, and ease of additions/features
    and documentation

Budiness users/investors:
    Ease of use and perhaps how they can gain money from this
    Harder to do - I have no idea how profitable this idea is
    I can at least make it seem extremely usable and intuitive

    usability and intuitiveness is all software devs can do for
    this side of the operation - unless they know how the idea
    can and should be sold - business models (probably)
