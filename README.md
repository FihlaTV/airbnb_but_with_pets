Progress report for Qing(Sabrina) and Cher  

March 21: we have a meeting and have some basic ideas to set up different pages, like how many pages we have and a basic structure of what each page should look like.

March 22: Qing found Cher and discussed with her how to store all data. She decided to learn database first and let me construct the basic structure of our app (contents for each page)

March 24: Cher made the firebase work just for adding users and checked some authentication issues. Qing have made views for each page and decided to share with groups

The week of March 27: Cher implements login and sign up and Qing made the switch from pages to pages work and asked Kenny to find out bugs. Then, Qing finished implementing the account page but still didnt know how to add profile pictures. 

The week of April 3: Qing implemented the post and enabled users to make new post. However, the key issue is to retrieve from the database and we had no idea how to link the userâ€™s information with his/her posts. We had the duty assigned. 

The week of April 10th: Cher added the comments option to post and  so Qing started to try how to search old posts from the firebase. Also, Qing added the default values for user input.
of new posts and search options to prevent users from entering nothing, which caused a huge problem when we search.

The week of April 17th: Cher finished some initial search options but there are still some questions on how to search with multiple choices like both dogs and cats. Qing helped her filter unnecessary information so that she had some basic logics.

The week of April 28th: Cher finally figured out the search and make the post page work. The post page can show the previous posts for the same user. TA helps us organize the database and save user's profile pictures. We tried to merge Kenney's code but failed. 

The week of May 1st, Cher and Qing finalize some CSS implements and test our apps.
