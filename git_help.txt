Git help
Our git workflow is 3 branches: master, develop, and test. We each have feature branches off of test, and when we finish a feature,
merge the feature branch with test. Every two weeks, we'll merge test with develop - test it then rebase with master.

When I say rebase, use git rebase: Don't use git merge. git merge causes master to get further than develop.

Note, for commit messages,
read this link: https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/

For creating new branches:
    git checkout -b <name>

For checking out anyone else's work:
    git checkout <name>

If there are any hard conflicts or anything like that, ask for help.
If the code breaks, try a hard reset and if that doesn't workout:
git checkout <previous commit hash>
then create a new branch and retry everything.
